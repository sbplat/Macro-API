Before opening an issue, please check to make sure someone hasn't already opened an issue about it.

## Pull Requests

Before you start working on an issue, please comment on the issue and wait for it to be assigned to you. This is to avoid multiple people working on the same issue.

Once you have been assigned an issue, you can start working on it. When you are ready to submit your changes, open a pull request.
For a detailed pull request tutorial, see [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).
